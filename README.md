## Data-Driven Sign Language Video Generation

This the repository for the paper: SignSynth: Data-Driven Sign Language Video Generation. 

gloss2pose was originally written in tensorflow and later ported to pytorch. I included some sample 2D data under gloss2ppose_pytorch/data. For the full 2D data, please contact me under s.m.stoll@surrey.ac.uk. I cannot grant you access to the actual SMILE dataset as I am no longer associated with the owners of the dataset. Please contact n.camgoz@surrey.ac.uk for enquiries regarding this dataset.
